/**
 * TLDR: reads input text and prints a JS string that represents that input text.
 *
 * Reads the text from a standard input. (let's call that text INPUT-TEXT)
 * Prints a piece of JS code to standard output.
 *   That JS code consists of string (or concatenation of strings) - call it OUT-STRING.
 * OUT-STRING represents an INPUT-TEXT in such a form,
 * that when OUT-STRING is printed by some JS script, its output should contain the INPUT-TEXT.
 *
 * Try it by running on this file:)
 *   cat examples/text2string.ts | node build/examples/text2string.js
